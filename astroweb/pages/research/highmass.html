		    The formation of high-mass stars remains one of the
		    most significant unsolved problems in all of
		    astrophysics. These stars, with masses greater than
		      8-10 solar masses, eventually explode as supernovae
		      and produce most of the heavy elements in the
		      universe. Through their winds, UV radiation, and
		      supernovae massive stars dominate energy injection
		      into the interstellar medium (ISM). Observations of
		      HII regions produced by massive stars are a prime
		      tool for extragalactic astronomers to determine the
		      star formation rate and abundances in
		      galaxies. Massive stars also affect planet
		      formation: many low-mass stars are born in clusters
		      containing massive stars whose UV radiation can
		      destroy protoplanetary disks. The photograph of
		      the Orion Nebula to the
		      right illustrates this process dramatically: the
		      bright blue stars are blowing material off the
		      dimmer green stars, giving them a cometary
		      appearance and creating the bright arcs around
		      the dimmer stars. (Image from John Bally, Dave
		      Devine, and Ralph Sutherland, using HST.)<p>

		  Despite the importance of massive star formation,
		  relatively little is known about it. Observations
		  are difficult because massive star forming sites are
		  heavily obscured by dust and therefore invisible in
		  optical and near-IR. Massive star forming sites are
		  rare and thus tend  to be farther from Earth than
		  low-mass star forming regions. Observations
		  therefore demand high spatial resolution. Massive
		  star formation occurs in clusters with high stellar
		  densities, so even greater resolution is required to
		  avoid confusion. In addition, massive stars destroy
		  their natal environment via HII regions. Much of
		  what we do know comes from observations of
		  ultracompact HII regions that become visible only
		  after star formation is nearly complete. The image
		      below illustrates this -- it shows a nebula in
		      the galaxy M33 that has formed a cluster of
		      massive stars in its center. The massive stars'
		      radiation is heating the nebula, causing it to
		      glow, and will eventually destroy it. (Image
		      from Hui Yang, using HST.)<p>

		  Massive star formation also poses major theoretical
		  challenges. Massive stars begin burning their
		  nuclear fuel and radiating prodigious amounts of
		  energy while still accreting. Acceleration due to
		  radiation pressure on dust grains in the  accreting
		  material can exceed that due to gravity for all
		  stars above about 10 solar mases. This leads to the
		  question: how is it possible to sustain a
		  sufficiently high-mass accretion rate onto a massive 
		  protostellar cores despite the radiation pressure on
		  the accreting envelope? Proposed solutions include
		  changing the composition of dust grains, accreting
		  matter through a disk, and altering the effective
		  radiation temperature to which the infalling
		  material is exposed. However, there is still no
		  definitive solution to this classic
		  problem.<p>

		      Numerical simulations have not fared any better;
		      for realistic initial conditions, the most
		      massive star formed in a published calculation
		      is still less than 10 solar masses. The severe
		      computational demands of the problem forced
		      previous workers to overly simplify the behavior
		      of the dust grains and to work in either one or
		      two dimensions. Using our 3-D
		      self-gravitational, multi-fluid,
		      radiation-hydrodynamics code with full adaptive
		      mesh refinement (AMR) on parallel supercomputers
		      we are simulating massive star formation
		      without these limitations. We will correctly
		      treat coagulation and shattering of dust grains.
		      The high resolution allowed by AMR enables us to 
		      work in three-dimensions, accurately modeling
		      the inherently three-dimensional effects that have a
		      direct bearing on how massive stars can
		      form. For example, interaction of the radiation with the
		      infalling dusty envelope is Rayleigh-Taylor
		      and possibly also Kelvin-Helmholtz
		      unstable. Accurate simulations capable of
		      treating these effects self-consistently are
		      vital building a self-consistent theory of
		      high-mass star formation.<p>
