		    The majority of star formation occurs in dense turbulent clouds of molecular Hydrogen. 
		    These Giant Molecular Clouds 
		    (GMCs) set the stage for the formation of protostellar systems by the 
		    gravitational collapse of dense regions within the GMC that fragment 
		    into smaller core components that in turn condense into stars. Hence 
		    the natal environment, through the complex interplay of gravity, 
		    magnetic fields, and supersonic turbulence, is an important influence 
		    on star formation. Exactly how these mechanisms shape the final 
		    properties of stars both collectively and individually is poorly understood.
		    Important questions include:  What is the origin of the stellar Initial Mass 
		    Funtion (IMF)? How is the 
		    final mass of a star determined? What determines whether a core forms a 
		    single star, binary, or multiple system? <p>

		    There has been a wide body of observation comparing and cataloging the 
		    properties of dense cores and Young Stellar Objects (YSO) across diverse star 
		    formation sites. This evidence suggests that 
		    core properties are greatly influenced by their proximity to other YSO 
		    and cores, which may be intimately related to the generation and sustenance
		    of supersonic turbulence. Current theoretical thinking connects the IMF
		    to the large-scale turbulence within a GMC.
			In this picture, 
		    the distribution
		    of densities generated within a turbulent medium naturally gives rise to a 
		    power-law IMF similar to what is observed at the high end, and a substellar
		    IMF which depends on the degree of turbulence of the parent region. 
		    Observation shows that the IMF of stars and prestellar 
		    cores are virtually identical, and 
		    so study of the initial conditions, properties, and evolution of prestellar 
		    cores is vital to answer the above questions.<p>

		  The image below depicts a density volume rendering of a
		  magneto-hydrodynamic simulation showing the gas filaments
		  formed in an infrared dark cloud (IRDC) 800,000 years after
		  the highly supersonically turbulent region began
		  gravitational collapse.  The extent of the main filament is
		  about 4.5 parsecs in length and equivalent to 660 solar
		  masses. The highest density fragments in the filament (red)
		  show regions where molecular cloud cores are forming which
		  upon further gravitational collapse form low mass and high
		  mass stars.<p>

		  An animation of density volume rendering of a
		  magneto-hydrodynamic simulation showing gas filaments formed
		  in an infrared dark cloud (IRDC) 5 parsecs in size, 800,000
		  years after the turbulent region began gravitational collapse
		  is created by Tim Sandstrom (NASA visual team). A rotation
		  around the IRDC zooms in on the main filament 4.5 parsecs in
		  length showing a dense molecular core of 0.1 parsec size.
		  Continued simulation of this region shows further collapse,
		  filamentation, protostellar outflows and the early stage
		  formation of a high mass star.<p>
