Solving Problems on a Grid
</div>
<div class="text-entry">
	  Central to any direct computational method is the
		  manner in which it discretizes the continuous domain
		  of interest into a grid of many individual
		  elements. This grid may be <I>static</I>,
		  established once and for all at the beginning of
		  the computation, or it may be <I>dynamic</I>,
		  tracking the features of the result as the
		  computation progresses. If the computation has features
		  which one wants to track which are much smaller than
		  the overall scale of the problem, and which
		  move in time, then one must either include
		  many more static grids to cover the region of
		  interest, or adopt a dynamic scheme. The
		  advantages of a dynamic gridding scheme are:<P>

		  1) Increased computational savings over a static grid
		  approach.<P>

		  2) Increased storage savings over a static grid
		  approach.<P>

		  3) Complete control of grid resolution, compared to
		  the fixed resolution of a static grid approach.

Introduction to Adaptive Mesh Refinement
</div>
<div class="text-entry">

		  In a series of papers, Berger, Oliger, and Colella
		  developed an algorithm for dynamic gridding called
		  local adaptive mesh refinement. The algorithm begins
		  with the entire computational domain covered with a
		  coarsely resolved base-level regular Cartesian grid.
		  As the calculation progresses, individual grid cells
		  are tagged for refinement, using a criterion that
		  can either be user-supplied (i.e. mass per cell
		  remains constant, hence higher density regions are
		  more highly resolved) or based on Richardson
		  extrapolation.<p>

		  All tagged cells are then refined, meaning that a
		  finer grid is overlayed on the coarse one. After
		  refinement, individual grid patches on a single
		  fixed level of refinement are passed off to an
		  integrator which advances those cells in
		  time. Finally, a correction procedure is implemented
		  to correct the transfer along coarse-fine grid
		  interfaces, to insure that the amount of any
		  conserved quantity leaving one cells exactly
		  balances the amount enter the bordering cell. If at
		  some point the level of refinement in a cell is
		  greater than required, the high resolution grid may
		  be removed and replaced with a coarser one.<P>

		  The image to the left
		  shows the grid structure of an AMR calculation
		  of a shock impacting an inclined slope. Each of the
		  boxes is a grid; the more boxes it is nested within,
		  the higher the level of refinments. It is adapted From
		  Colella and Crutchfield (1994).</P>

		  As the image shows, the algorithm uses high
		  resolution grids only at the <i>physical
		    locations</i> and <i>times</i>
		  where they are required. This lets us solve problems
		  that are completely intractable on a uniform grid;
		  for example,we have used the code to model the
		  filamentary nature of isothermal collapse down to an
		  effective resolution of 131,072 cells per initial
		  cloud radius, corresponding to a resolution of 10^15
		  cells on a uniform grid.<p>

		  fluid dynamics, see the <a
