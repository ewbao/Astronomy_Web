		  Beginning in 1994, we introduced multi-dimensional
		  <a href="AMR.html">Adaptive Mesh Refinement
		    (AMR)</a> hydrodynamical techniques into astrophysics
		  <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1994ApJ...420..213K&db_key=AST&high=3a91989b8829064">
		    (Klein, McKee and Colella 1994)</a> in a study of the
		    interaction of supernova blast waves with
		    interstellar clouds. The high resolution afforded
		    by AMR shed new light upon the key hydrodynamical
		    instabilities responsible for the destruction and
		    mixing of the cloud with the interstellar medium.
		    Since then, the thrust of our research has been
		    twofold: (i) to develop and implement
		    state-of-the-art parallel, multi-dimensional AMR
		    algorithms and codes incorporating the full range
		    of coupled physics necessary to address a wide
		    spectrum of problems in   astrophysical fluid
		    dynamics, including multi-fluid hydrodynamics,
		    gravity, radiation transport, and magnetic fields; 
		    and (ii) to use these powerful AMR codes to
		    investigate fundamental problems in  astrophysical
		    fluid dynamics that are characterized by a wide
		    range of length and time scales, for which AMR is
		    essential.<p>

		    The group is currently using our AMR methodology
		    to study a number of major problems in
		    astrophysical fluid dynamics:<p>
